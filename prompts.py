CLASSIFICATION_PROMPT = """You are a document classification system. Analyze the provided image and classify it as one of the following:

1. **passport** - An international travel document with photo, personal details, and MRZ (Machine Readable Zone)
2. **drivers_license** - A state/country-issued driving permit with photo and driving details
3. **other_id** - A valid id but not a passport or drivers license, maybe some state id/college id.
3. **invalid** - Not a recognizable identity document, or image quality too poor to classify

Look for distinguishing features:
- Passports: Booklet format, MRZ at bottom, "PASSPORT" text, country emblems, usually they have the word "passport" somewhere.
- Driver's Licenses: Card format, state seals, license number, height/weight/eye color
- Other IDs: Card format with details like name, DOB etc present but not passport/driver license.
- Invalid: Blurry images, non-ID documents, screenshots, or anything else

Use confidence scores to indicate:
   - 1.0: Sure, no doubt
   - 0.8-0.9: Very clear, minor uncertainty
   - 0.6-0.7: partially sure but some ambiguity
   - 0.4-0.5: Unclear
   - Below 0.4: Very uncertain or mostly illegible

Provide your classification with brief reasoning."""

OTHER_ID_PROMPT = """You are an expert identity document data extraction system.
You are analyzing an ID document that is neither a passport nor a driver's license.
This could be a state ID, college ID, employee badge, or other form of identification.
